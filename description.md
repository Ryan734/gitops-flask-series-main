*Learn the different ways to deploy and maintain Flask applications using GitOps on Kubernetes.*

In this course, we'll be setting up a GitOps operator on Kubernetes and deploying a Flask app. As the course progresses, we'll increase complexity and explore how GitOps helps to ease this. This course will be interactive, so get your terminal ready as we'll share all the code, step-by-step.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Explain what GitOps is and why to you may want to use it
1. Set up Flux on Kubernetes
1. Practice Test-driven Development against the Kubernetes API
1. Build a Helm Chart and deploy it with GitOps
1. Deploy Flask applications on multiple Kubernetes clusters using GitOps

## Tools and Technologies

1. Python
1. Flask
1. pytest
1. Docker
1. Requests
1. GitOps / Flux
1. Kubernetes
1. Helm / Helm Operator

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should preferably have strong working knowledge of Python 3.

You should also have a solid understanding of the following Internet and web fundamentals:

1. IP addresses, URL structures, and DNS
1. Web browsers and web servers
1. HTTP requests and responses

It is helpful to know the following but by no means compulsory:

1. Intermediate level understanding of how the TCP and HTTP protocol work.
