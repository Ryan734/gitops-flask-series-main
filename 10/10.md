# Conclusion / A Brief History

Let's discuss a brief history of CI / CD and container orchestration.

## Kubernetes and Container Orchestration

### Container orchestration frameworks

Around 2011, [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) started to gain popularity in the open source community. It was quickly adopted by leading engineering teams such as Yelp, Airbnb and even Apple forked a version. Apache Mesos was comparable to Google's internal [Borg](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2015/04/borg-predecessor-to-kubernetes/) framework. Alongside Mesos many other commercial offerings existed but many startups and engineering teams begun the movement to containerization. Around 2014 Kubernetes was open sourced by Google and soon took over the container orchestration space.

The reason why Kubernetes gained popularity was because of its ease of use, powerful CLI tooling and declarative approach. Apache Mesos and its frameworks around 2017 still did not have a CLI or resource definitions, rather the Mesos ecosystem was highly complex to setup and managed offerings were hard to find. The major cloud providers were quick to offer managed Kubernetes clusters making the developers life much easier and pretty much engineering teams and startups decided to go for the easy option of using managed Kubernetes hosted on one of the major cloud providers.

### Service Meshes

As applications started to get bigger and more complex, microservices became common. Many engineering teams embarked on company wide projects to break down the monolith. At the same time Docker and containers in general were gaining popularity. With the advent of container orchestration frameworks and microservices there came a need for service meshes. Previously service meshes were almost always in house.

When deploying distributed systems there are tools to help and enhance the experience by using a service mesh such as [Istio](https://istio.io/) or [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io/). A service mesh provides a host of features such as mutual TLS, multi-cluster communication, retries, timeouts to mention a few. All the features are very powerful and provide support for more resilient microservices.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

Deploying via automated fashion has a long history and GitOps is part of movement that has begun to take hold in the open source community.

### Jenkins

In 2005 Sun Microsystems released a Continuous Integration tool called Hudson. This soon took off as a popular tool to build and deploy all sorts of application even to this day and later was renamed to [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) in 2011. The idea of having a "one-click" build and deploy was possible with Jenkins and it took out the repetitive task of deploying manually by SSHing into servers. Jenkins supported executing shell scripts which gave developers freedom to customize their pipelines. During this time Jenkins had many commercial rivals such as Microsoft's VSTS, CruiseControl and in-house built CI/CD software.

### CI / CD offering explosion

For todays engineer it is almost like a kid in a candy store, we have [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/), [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/devops/?nav=min), [Gitlab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to name a few. All these CI / CD offerings are trying to automate the developers work flow by providing their own work flow that integrates with pretty much all the tools whether that is Jira, Trello or Asana.

### The Push vs Pull Approach

The push approach refers to accessing servers to deploy an application. This is a traditional approach where the CD server is given access to the servers that host the application and code is then "pushed", normally copied to the server in some form. A "pull" approach is when the application servers poll an endpoint and deploy the code if there are any changes. The servers in this case simply need access to the endpoint and where to fetch the code from. GitOps takes the pull approach, where the git server hosting the code is the endpoint. Once a change occurs the new resource is deployed.

## Conclusion

It has been my pleasure to write up this course about Kubernetes and GitOps. My aim was to give a basic understanding of how a TDD approach can be taken even when deploying infrastructure and application components.
