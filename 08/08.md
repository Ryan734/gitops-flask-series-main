# Deploying a Flask application with Helm

Helm charts are great for maintaining long running complex applications. Web servers tend to be long running applications which makes Helm a perfect solution for bundling and deploying our Flask application. In this section we will explore the Helm Controller and how we can use it to manage the life cycle of an application deployed on Kubernetes.

## Setting up Part 8

Create a new directory called `part8` inside the `gitops_tutorial` directory and copy `test_end_to_end.py` and `test_gitops.py` from part 7. We will be running commands from `gitops_tutorial/part8` and `gitops-series` directories.

## Building the chart

A Helm chart consists of a `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml` and a `templates` directory. The `Chart.yaml` consists of metadata about the chart, like chart version, description, authors etc. The `templates` directory houses the Kubernetes manifests that make up the application such as Deployments, Services, Ingresses. It is referred to as templates because Helm allows us to template our manifests. Finally the `values.yaml` are the default values that are substituted into our templates. Let's begin by defining our `Chart.yaml`.

```yaml
# gitops-series/chart/Chart.yaml

apiVersion: v1
name: flask-application
version: 1
description: "Flask application"
sources:
- https://github.com/paktek123/gitops-series # replace with your repository
maintainers:
- name: Neeran Gul # replace with your name
appVersion: 0.1.0
```

We define some basic metadata about our Flask application. Let's create our `values.yaml` under the `chart` directory in the root of our `gitops-series` repo.

```yaml
# gitops-series/chart/values.yaml

name: flask-application
namespace: test-namespace
image: docker.io/library/flask-test-gitops:latest
replicas: 2
```

Let's define our `templates`.

```bash
# create templates directory
$ cd gitops-series
$ mkdir -p chart/templates
```

```yaml
# gitops-series/chart/templates/deployment.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.name }}
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicas }}
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: {{ .Values.name }}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: {{ .Values.name }}
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: {{ .Values.name }}
        image: {{ .Values.image }}
        imagePullPolicy: Never
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000
```

```yaml
# gitops-series/chart/templates/service.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.name }}
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
spec:
  selector:
    app: {{ .Values.name }}
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5000
```

```yaml
# gitops-series/chart/templates/ingress.yaml

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.name }}
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: {{ .Values.name }}
          servicePort: 5000
```

In the above we have placeholders for our values. These can be overridden when we deploy our chart. Notice we do not move our `namespace.yaml` in our templates this is because a Namespace encompasses all of our resources, if we were to say delete and purge our Helm chart it would delete the Namespace too and delete our application, this alongside GitOps (with GC/prune on) makes it very easy to delete whole Namespaces with ease. In this particular case it is best practice to leave the namespace out of the Helm chart.

Our chart is now ready to deploy. Under normally circumstances one can simply run `helm install ...` and deploy the chart to the Kubernetes cluster but since we are deploying via GitOps we need to use the helm controller. Commit and push up the `chart` directory. 

## Deploying our Helm chart via Helm controller

Helm controller works by monitoring the HelmRelease custom resource definition (CRD) and running the Helm operations for us. In this case, first Flux will create the HelmRelease CRD by applying the YAML, then Helm controller will helm install. We are going to use our new workflow, moving to a Helm chart can be considered a refactor of how the application is deployed, we are going to deploy to the development environment first. Let's create our HelmRelease, Kustomization and Namespace definition in the development path in our gitops-series repository.

```yaml
# gitops-series/development/flask/kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - HelmRelease.yaml
  - namespace.yaml
---
# gitops-series/development/flask/namespace.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: test-namespace
---
# gitops-series/development/flask/HelmRelease.yaml
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: flask
  namespace: test-namespace
spec:
  interval: 5m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: "./chart"
      version: "2"
      sourceRef:
        kind: GitRepository
        name: gitops-series
        namespace: flux-system
      interval: 1m
  values:
    name: flask
```
The `values` section is to override any variables to make each Helm release unique. In the chart section we fetch our chart from our git repository. Since we are deploying via a Helm chart now, we are going to remove `deployment.yaml`, `ingress.yaml` and `service.yaml`, we will leave `namespace.yaml`. We need to point to the `kustomization.yaml` in our `development/flask` directory instead of the `base`.

```yaml
# gitops-series/development/kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - ../base/ingress-nginx/
  - ./flask/
patchesStrategicMerge:
  - patches/ingress-nginx-deployment.yaml
  - patches/ingress-nginx-service.yaml
```

In the above we are being specific about our ingress-nginx and flask Deployments since they are not referenced in the same kustomization anymore. Once we have tested our Deployment works in development we can push our changes to base. Let's commit and push up our changes.

```bash
$ kubectl get kustomization -n flux-system
NAME                READY   STATUS                                                            AGE
flask-application   True    Applied revision: main/b9b034f3ce8840a41607488d4d44599350e2dde5   8h
flux-system         True    Applied revision: main/2a8c76686cc1a8dc29eee54fa624fd362024141c   8h
# check if the HelmRelease is successful
$ kubectl get hr flask -n test-namespace
NAME    READY   STATUS                             AGE
flask   True    Release reconciliation succeeded   7m58s
```
In the above we see that the HelmRelease has successfully deployed! Let's check out if the Pods, Service and Ingress was created.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n test-namespace
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
flask-7fcd4c6d5d-gbx82   1/1     Running   0          28m
flask-7fcd4c6d5d-wsmbj   1/1     Running   0          28m
$ kubectl get svc -n test-namespace

$ kind load docker-image flask-test-gitops:latest --name cluster1
Image: "flask-test-gitops:latest" with ID "sha256:07c17872b18a20e249c10ccf9db21fe38b8fd9b03d826257d55d2b9ca8bc3a45" not yet present on node "cluster1-control-plane", loading...
```
Our Flask application is fully deployed with Flux v2! We notice that Helm Controller does not require us to deploy a separate component rather Flux now contains all we need to deploy our application on Kubernetes.

Looks like the deploy succeeded. If the deploy has failed then we have to make sure all the resources deleted successfully, also try running `kubectl describe helmrelease flask -n test-namespace` to find the actual error for why the release failed. Let's proceed to run our GitOps and end to end tests. Run the below from `gitops_tutorial/part8` directory.

```sh

## Upgrading a Helm Release

We have been successful in deploying our Helm release. To upgrade the release we simply need to edit our chart in the git repository. Let's make a small change to see how helm operator upgrades the release. 

```yaml
# gitops_tutorial/part8/chart/templates/service.yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.name }}
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
  labels:
    test: label
spec:
  selector:
    app: {{ .Values.name }}
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5000
```

```yaml
# gitops_tutorial/part8/chart/Chart.yaml

apiVersion: v1
name: flask-application
version: 2
description: "Flask application"
sources:
  - https://github.com/paktek123/gitops-series
maintainers:
  - name: Neeran Gul
appVersion: 0.1.0
```

In the above we added an additional label and bumped up the chart to version 2. Let's watch the status of our Helm Release resource. We can download the Helm 3 client from [here](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases) to have a look in detail.

```sh
$ kubectl get hr flask -n test-namespace
NAME    READY     STATUS                       AGE
flask   Unknown   Reconciliation in progress   2d21h
$ kubectl get hr -n test-namespace
NAME    READY   STATUS                             AGE
flask   True    Release reconciliation succeeded   2d21h

$ helm ls --namespace test-namespace
NAME 	NAMESPACE     	REVISION	UPDATED                              	STATUS  	CHART              	APP VERSION
flask	test-namespace	3       	2020-12-31 22:07:40.2548279 +0000 UTC	deployed	flask-application-2	0.1.0
```

The output above shows that the chart is now version 2 hence the upgrade was successful. Rolling back is fairly easy by running `helm rollback flask |revision to rollback| --namespace test-namespace` if any of our tests fail.

## Pulling the Helm Chart from different sources

In the above section we downloaded our Helm Chart from the git repository as referenced below.

```yaml
# gitops-series/development/flask/HelmRelease.yaml
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: flask
  namespace: test-namespace
spec:
  interval: 5m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: "./chart"
      version: "2"
      sourceRef:
        kind: GitRepository # <--- From Git Repository
        name: gitops-series
        namespace: flux-system
      interval: 1m
  values:
    name: flask
```
The source controller supports multiple sources for fetching Helm Charts such as GitRepository, Bucket and HelmRepository. The Bucket CRD references an S3 compatible bucket that works very similar to how we deployed in part 6. In this section we are going to cover the HelmRepository CRD and setup Helm Repository to host our Helm Chart.

### Deploying Chart Museum

To setup our local Helm Repository we are going to use [Chart Museum](https://github.com/helm/chartmuseum). Chart Museum is maintained by the maintainer of Helm and is an exposes an API that let's us upload (and retrieve) our chart to a storage of choice such as S3 or a local disk. Let's define our container in `docker-compose.yaml`.

```yaml
# gitops_tutorial/part8/docker-compose.yaml
version: '3.2'
services:
  chartmuseum:
    image: ghcr.io/helm/chartmuseum:v0.13.1
    container_name: chartmuseum
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - STORAGE=local
      - STORAGE_LOCAL_ROOTDIR=/tmp
```

Let's run our Chart Museum server.

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
Creating chartmuseum ... done
$ docker ps
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                              COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                           NAMES

3d256739e9e3   kindest/node:v1.19.1               "/usr/local/bin/entr…"   3 days ago      Up 3 days      0.0.0.0:81->81/tcp, 127.0.0.1:65354->6443/tcp   cluster2-control-plane
```
We now need to push our Helm Chart to this Helm Repository. To do so we can use the [Helm Push](https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push) plugin.

```sh
$ helm plugin install https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push.git
Downloading and installing helm-push v0.9.0 ...
https://github.com/chartmuseum/helm-push/releases/download/v0.9.0/helm-push_0.9.0_darwin_amd64.tar.gz
Installed plugin: push
```

Once installed we now need to add our local Helm Repository to Helm Repositories. Then we will push our Helm Chart in our gitops-series git repository.

```sh
$ helm repo add localchartmuseum http://localhost:8080
"localchartmuseum" has been added to your repositories
# cd to gitops-series/chart
$ helm push . localchartmuseum
Pushing flask-application-2.tgz to localchartmuseum...
Done.
# To confirm it was uploaded
$ curl localhost:8080/index.yaml
apiVersion: v1

```

### Setting up the HelmRepository CRD

We now need to setup the HelmRepository CRD and reference it our HelmRelease CRD. Apply the following YAML by running `kubectl apply -f helm_repository`.

```yaml
# gitops_tutorial/part8/helm_repository.yaml
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: localchartmuseum
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  url: http://192.168.0.11:8080 # replace with your local IP, same as part 6
  interval: 10m
```

Let's check the status of our CRD.

```sh
$ kubectl get helmrepository -n flux-system
NAME               URL                        READY   STATUS                                                       AGE
localchartmuseum   http://192.168.0.11:8080   True    Fetched revision: 67f27c50911c2a0b8061935fbba8ea1332240b07   12s
```

Now to reference in our HelmRelease.

```yaml
# gitops-series/development/flask/HelmRelease.yaml
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2beta1
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: flask
  namespace: test-namespace
spec:
  interval: 5m
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: "flask-application"
      version: "2"
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: localchartmuseum
        namespace: flux-system
      interval: 1m
  values:
    name: flask
```

The above needs to be committed and pushed. We can now check if the Helm Chart was downloaded successfully and the Helm Release deployed.

```sh
$ kubectl get helmchart -n flux-system
NAME                   CHART               VERSION   SOURCE KIND      SOURCE NAME        READY   STATUS                AGE

    Reason:                        ReconciliationSucceeded
    Status:                        True
    Type:                          Ready

    Reason:                        UpgradeSucceeded
    Status:                        True
    Type:                          Released
```
We can see that the chart has been successfully deployed using our local chart museum.

## Deploying to the other clusters

We have successfully deployed to our development cluster. I will leave deploying to the staging and production cluster to the reader. Please run the `test_gitops.py` and `test_end_to_end.py` to confirm if the Deployments are successful. A rough set of instructions:
- move the `development/flask` into the `base`
- update the `kustomization.yaml` in development, staging, production to point to `../base/` under resources

## Directory structure

To see how the directory structure should look like, checkout the part8 branch on my [gitops-series](https://www.github.com/paktek123/gitops-series) git repository.

## Summary

In this part we learn how to build a Helm chart and deploy it via GitOps using the Helm controller. We explored how to upgrade a chart and how to pull Helm Chart from a Helm Repository and GitRepository.
