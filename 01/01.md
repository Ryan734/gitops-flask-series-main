# Theoretical Concepts

Welcome to this course! Kubernetes usage has grown substaintially in the past few years and adoption rates across the community have increased. In this course we will take deep dive into how to write tests against the Kubernetes API and how to verify that our resources have been created. As the course progresses we will deploy via GitOps and explore all the different configuration options that have been provided. This course is fully interactive and readers are highly encouraged to follow the chapters step by step and deploy all the components as mentioned. The end goal of this course is that the reader understands GitOps in-depth and is able to deploy complex applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters. Below we cover some concepts and tools that we will be using heavily during this course.

## GitOps

GitOps applies the best practices from DevOps for application development -- collaboration, version control, automated testing and compliance, and CI/CD -- to infrastructure automation.

From [GitOps.tech](https://www.gitops.tech):

> GitOps is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment for cloud native applications. It focuses on a developer-centric experience when operating infrastructure, by using tools developers are already familiar with, including Git and Continuous Deployment tools.

> The core idea of GitOps is having a Git repository that always contains declarative descriptions of the infrastructure currently desired in the production environment and an automated process to make the production environment match the described state in the repository. If you want to deploy a new application or update an existing one, you only need to update the repository -- the automated process handles everything else. Itâ€™s like having cruise control for managing your applications in production.

Be sure to review [Why I should use GitOps](https://www.gitops.tech/#why-should-i-use-gitops).

## Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a container orchestration framework open sourced by Google. It has gained popularity quickly in the open source community and is the go-to solution for container orchestration. Kubernetes has a powerful API and resources are typically represented in JSON or YAML. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with Kubernetes [fundamentals](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/) before taking this course.

## Kind

[kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), which stands for "Kubernetes in docker", will be used to deploy a local Kubernetes cluster for running our tests against.

### What about Minikube?

Like kind, [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) is a tool used for running a local Kubernetes cluster. It's maintained by the Kubernetes maintainers. What sets Minikube apart from kind is that it supports multiple "drivers" (known as hypervisors) to run a local Kubernetes cluster such as VirtualBox, KVM, Hyper-V and Docker amongst others. Minikube, which was open-sourced in 2016, has also been around longer than kind, which was open-sourced in 2018.

We'll be using kind in this course as it gives us the ability to deploy local Docker images into nodes by exporting them into the Kubernetes nodes themselves without worrying about size. That said, if your preference is Minikube then this course is fully compatible with Minikube except the commands are not explicitly given for Minikube.

## Flux

[Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) v2 is a GitOps operator that ensures the state of a git repository in a Kubernetes Cluster. We will be deploying Flux on a local Kubernetes cluster and exploring its features throughout this course. Flux v2 is maintained directly by [WeaveWorks](https://www.weave.works/). Features of Flux v2 include a powerful CLI, allowing us to install Flux v2 on the command line and the ability to set up our Github repository SSH keys with ease. We will explore the internals of Flux v2 and go through practical examples of how Flux works in production.
